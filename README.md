# basic_forecast_automation
## This is a quite basic weather forecast automation program based on Python 3 programming language. 
### If you have a text editor such as sublime.text, Visual Studio Code or any other text editor that's reliable to play with, you are good to go.
### But if you don't have it yet then go to https://code.visualstudio.com/download and download Visual Studio Code.
#### Copy the forecast automation python file from this link or check out my repository with an uploaded file called auto_forecast.py:
https://github.com/JoeMamaHackBoy/basic_forecast_automation/blob/main/auto_forecast.py
#### VERY IMPORTANT!
##### Make sure that you use your own API key after you create an account from openweathermap.org and insert it inside the variables called "API_KEY" after you copy the python file! otherwise it won't show http request in a json format file that will show the weather information. Just follow the guide below to get your API key!
